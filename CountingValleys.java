  An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike that took exactly steps steps, for every step it was noted if it was an uphill, U, or 
  a downhill, D step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step up or down represents a 1 unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:

A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.
A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.
Given the sequence of up and down steps during a hike, find and print the number of valleys walked through.
